# SOLotery
## _A transparent lottery validated by Solana Blockchain_

SOLotery is a dapp, developed with the purpose of clarifying the lottery business, using blockchain technology so as not to depend on third parties. Offering to the market:

- Traceability 🔍
- Security ⛓️
- Clarity 👨‍💻
- Dividends 💸

## Traceability

Since everything is validated by blockchain, you can have a clear record of all transactions in daylight. All the source code of the program running on the blockchain is available [here](https://github.com/mateolafalce/SOLotery/blob/main/lib.rs)

## Security

After seeing the big hacks towards pdas based programs, the code structure was changed to store the data securely in the application itself. This not only provides us with greater technical security, but also clarifies critical functions such as the election and the sending of the money to the respective winner.

## Clarity

Taking into account the scams that have occurred in cryptographic projects together with the respective increase in mistrust in them, it was decided that all the code be public and open. SOLotery faces the great centralized gaming monopolies around the world with decentralization, low prices and pure transparency. As _Friedrich August von Hayek_ writes on **The Road to Serfdom**:
> Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, 
if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another. 
But if we face a monopolist we are at his absolute mercy.

## Dividends

Of the total amount that is sent to the winner, 2% remains and is distributed as royalties to all SOLotery owners. 7 parts are put up for sale from day one and the person who has the best proposal gets the divestments. Since there are only 7 dividends, the owners will have to be generous with their proposals, since the competition increases with greater equity in prices. The remaining property is to maintain the program on the blockchain and bear all transaction costs.
